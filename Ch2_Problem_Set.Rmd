Load data1 which is already in working directory, and named data1. View data1
```{r}

x = load("/Users/allenchurch/Ch2_Exercise2_Olympics.Rdata1")
View(x)
```


2a. Summarize medals, athletes, and GDP data11

```{r}
summary(data11$medals)
summary(data11$athletes)
summary(data11$GDP)
```

2b. List first 5 observations for country, year, medals, athletes, and GDP data1

```{r}
##Create cols with 5 column names, subset data1 with cols, and print first 5 rows
cols <- c("country", "year", "medals", "athletes", "GDP")
subset <- data1[cols]
subset[1:5,]
```

2c. How many observations are there for each year?
```{r}
#Create table with year column in data1
table(data1$year)
```

2d. Produce scatterplot of medals and number of athletes. Describe relationship depicted.

The relationship depicted below shows high clustering in the number of athletes that received 0 medals. It also shows that a majority - or close to a majority - of athletes received under 10 medals. Moreover, the number of athletes that received 30 or more medals is incredibly low with a count of 5 athletes. It also shows a positive correlation between number of athletes and number of medals won.

```{r}
plot(data1$medals, data1$athletes, main="Scatterplot of Medals and Number of Athletes",
     xlab="Medals", ylab = "Number of Athletes")
```
2e. Explain any suspicion you might have that other factors could explain the observed relationship between number of athletes and medals.

It seems there is a direct relationship between the number of athletes and the number of medals won by a country. 

2f. Create scatterplot of medals and GDP. Briefly describe any clear patterns.

There does not seem to be a clear relationship between GDP and number of medals earned. 

```{r}
plot(data1$medals, data1$GDP, main="Scatterplot of Medals and GDP",
     xlab="Medals", ylab = "GDP")
```

2g. Create scatterplot of medals and population. Briefly describe any clear patterns.

The relationship below shows that population size is not correlated with number of medals won. 

```{r}
plot(data1$medals, data1$population, main="Scatterplot of Medals and Population",
     xlab="Medals", ylab = "Population")
```

2h. Create scatterplot of medals and temperature. Describe any clear patterns

The relationship below shows that countries with high medal counts - more than 20 - have a temperature close to 40 degrees.

```{r}
plot(data1$medals, data1$temp, main="Scatterplot of Medals and Population",
     xlab="Medals", ylab = "Temperature in F")
```



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
